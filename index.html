      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The integration of advanced learning techniques in medical imaging offers unique opportunities for improved diagnostic accuracy and personalized treatment. However, limited data availability poses significant challenges, particularly for models requiring large datasets, leading to reduced generalizability and increased overfitting risk. This special session will address these challenges and explore strategies for extracting insights from small datasets. We will discuss methodologies such as data augmentation, transfer learning, active learning, and expert-driven annotations to enhance model performance. By emphasizing robust validation and interpretability, this session aims to advance medical imaging despite data limitations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "Learning from Small Data in Medical Imaging (LSD-MI)" session aims to address the challenges of limited data availability in the medical imaging field. We invite discussions on innovative methodologies that enhance model performance, including data augmentation, transfer learning, expert-driven annotations, and active learning. Topics of interest encompass strategies for improving diagnostic accuracy, ensuring model generalizability, and fostering interpretability in data-scarce environments. By bridging the gap between advanced learning techniques and clinical relevance, this session seeks to engage the broader data mining community and provide valuable insights for ADMA2025 attendees focused on practical applications in healthcare.

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Workshop Format</h2>
      <p>
        We estimate the number of submissions to be between 10 and 15. Papers should not exceed 15 pages in LNAI format. All submissions will undergo a single-blind peer-review process. Authors are required to designate a speaker upon submission. Each presentation will include significant discussion time, and we will encourage authors to prepare questions to stimulate interaction, either right after their talk or during a panel session. These components aim to create an engaging and collaborative atmosphere for exchanging ideas and promoting active dialogue in the context of small data in medical imaging.
